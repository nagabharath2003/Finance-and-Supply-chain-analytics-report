# Finance-and-Supply-chain-analytics-report
I had the opportunity to work on a comprehensive **Finance and Supply chain analytics report** for AtliQ Hardware, covering the fiscal years 2017 to 2022. This project allowed me to dive deep into SQL and leverage various advanced techniques to optimize data processing and reporting.
🌟 **Excited to Share My Latest Project: Sales and Finance Report for AtliQ!** 🌟

**Key Highlights:**

- 🔗 **Complex Joins**: Utilized various types of SQL joins to generate detailed reports, ensuring accurate and insightful data representation for Finance-and-Supply-chain-analytics-report:
  - **INNER JOIN**: Combined rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
  - **LEFT JOIN**: Retrieved all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
  - **RIGHT JOIN**: Retrieved all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.
  - **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Combined results from both left and right tables, including unmatched rows.

- ⚙️ **Stored Procedures**: Designed and implemented high-performing stored procedures that significantly reduced data retrieval time from **15 seconds to just 7 seconds**. This enhancement improved system efficiency and elevated the overall user experience.

- 🛠️ **User-Defined Functions**: Developed custom SQL functions that optimized database operations, enhancing query efficiency by **15%** for streamlined data processing and analysis.

- 📊 **Table Creation & Common Table Expressions**: Created and structured tables effectively, utilizing Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for better readability and organization of complex queries.

- 🔍 **Subqueries & Data Engineering**: Employed subqueries to simplify data retrieval processes and enhance the clarity of reports.

- 📈 **Indexing & Views**: Focused on data engineering best practices by creating indexes and views, which further optimized query performance and improved data accessibility.

This project not only honed my SQL skills but also deepened my understanding of data engineering principles. I’m excited to continue exploring the world of data and look forward to applying these skills in future projects!
